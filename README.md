Assignment 6 - Complete refactoring of graphics_v4.py

## Description

  Our objective is to modify the code in a way that allows for easy modifications such as altering object locations, quantities, and sizes. The main goal of this assignment is to enable the project to be quickly adapted to meet various requirements or design preferences.

  Using a previous coding project, we worked collaboratively to refactor the codebase. We thought carefully about how to structure the code to ensure it is modular and easy to maintain. Additionally, we ensured that the code adheres to best practices and coding conventions to ensure it is easily understandable by others.

  An important aspect of this assignment is the application of structural programming techniques. We edited the program in a functional form, focusing on organizing our code into clear, concise, and reusable functions that can be easily combined and modified as needed.
